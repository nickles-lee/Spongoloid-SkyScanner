# Spongo
Spontaneous Travel Web Application

So, let's say that one day you wake up and think to yourself, "Man, I wish I could travel more".

The sentiment is a nice one, but then you think of all the evil subclauses related with your dream of being more spontanous:
- I wish I had more time
- I wish I wouldn't blow all my money over a weekend
- I'm too lazy/it's too much effort to plan a flight, accommodation, food, fun, and inner-city transit stuff if I only have a few days or a free weekend.

Spongo is the real-time solution to all your pseudo-spontaneity travel problems.

In a clear, intuitive, user interface our web application integrates a budget over a 'free-time' interval. It then plans a complete, spontanous travel package for the user; while taking into account flight, accomodation, food and beverage, and transit costs for each potential travel destination.
